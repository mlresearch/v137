title: 'Inferential Induction: A Novel Framework for Bayesian Reinforcement Learning'
abstract: Bayesian Reinforcement Learning (BRL) offers a decision-theoretic solution
  to the reinforcement learning problem. While “model-based” BRL algorithms have focused
  either on maintaining a posterior distribution on models, BRL “model-free” methods
  try to estimate value function distributions but make strong implicit assumptions
  or approximations. We describe a novel Bayesian framework, \emph{inferential induction},
  for correctly inferring value function distributions from data, which leads to a
  new family of BRL algorithms. We design an algorithm, Bayesian Backwards Induction
  (BBI), with this framework. We experimentally demonstrate that BBI is competitive
  with the state of the art. However, its advantage relative to existing BRL model-free
  methods is not as great as we have expected, particularly when the additional computational
  burden is taken into account.
