title: Understanding Generalization Through Visualizations
abstract: The power of neural networks lies in their ability to generalize to unseen
  data, yet the underlying reasons for this phenomenon remain elusive. Numerous rigorous
  attempts have been made to explain generalization, but available bounds are still
  quite loose, and analysis does not always lead to true understanding. The goal of
  this work is to make generalization more intuitive. Using visualization methods,
  we discuss the mystery of generalization, the geometry of loss landscapes, and how
  the curse (or, rather, the blessing) of dimensionality causes optimizers to settle
  into minima that generalize well.
