title: 'Pitfalls in Machine Learning Research: Reexamining the Development Cycle'
abstract: Applied machine learning research has the potential to fuel further advances
  in data science, but it is greatly hindered by an ad hoc design process, poor data
  hygiene, and a lack of statistical rigor in model evaluation. Recently, these issues
  have begun to attract more attention as they have caused public and embarrassing
  issues in research and development. Drawing from our experience as machine learning
  researchers, we follow the applied machine learning process from algorithm design
  to data collection to model evaluation, drawing attention to common pitfalls and
  providing practical recommendations for improvements. At each step, case studies
  are introduced to highlight how these pitfalls occur in practice, and where things
  could be improved.
