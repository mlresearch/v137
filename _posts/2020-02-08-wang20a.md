title: Further Analysis of Outlier Detection with Deep Generative Models
abstract: The recent, counter-intuitive discovery that deep generative models (DGMs)
  can frequently assign a higher likelihood to outliers has implications for both
  outlier detection applications as well as our overall understanding of generative
  modeling. In this work, we present a possible explanation for this phenomenon, starting
  from the observation that a modelâ€™s typical set and high-density region may not
  conincide. From this vantage point we propose a novel outlier test, the empirical
  success of which suggests that the failure of existing likelihood-based outlier
  tests does not necessarily imply that the corresponding generative model is uncalibrated.
  We also conduct additional experiments to help disentangle the impact of low-level
  texture versus high-level semantics in differentiating outliers. In aggregate, these
  results suggest that modifications to the standard evaluation practices and benchmarks
  commonly applied in the literature are needed.
