title: A case for new neural network smoothness constraints
abstract: How sensitive should machine learning models be to input changes? We tackle
  the question of model smoothness and show that it is a useful inductive bias which
  aids generalization, adversarial robustness, generative modeling and reinforcement
  learning. We explore current methods of imposing smoothness constraints and observe
  they lack the flexibility to adapt to new tasks, they don’t account for data modalities,
  they interact with losses, architectures and optimization in ways not yet fully
  understood. We conclude that new advances in the field are hinging on finding ways
  to incorporate data, tasks and learning into our definitions of smoothness.
