title: Problems using deep generative models for probabilistic audio source separation
abstract: Recent advancements in deep generative modeling make it possible to learn
  prior distributions from complex data that subsequently can be used for Bayesian
  inference. However, we find that distributions learned by deep generative models
  for audio signals do not exhibit the right properties that are necessary for tasks
  like audio source separation using a probabilistic approach. We observe that the
  learned prior distributions are either discriminative and extremely peaked or smooth
  and non-discriminative. We quantify this behavior for two types of deep generative
  models on two audio datasets.
