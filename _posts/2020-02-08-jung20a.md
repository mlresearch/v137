title: A Worrying Analysis of Probabilistic Time-series Models for Sales Forecasting
abstract: Probabilistic time-series models become popular in the forecasting field
  as they help to make optimal decisions under uncertainty. Despite the growing interest,
  a lack of thorough analysis hinders choosing what is worth applying for the desired
  task. In this paper, we analyze the performance of three prominent probabilistic
  time-series models for sales forecasting. To remove the role of random chance in
  architecture’s performance, we make two experimental principles; 1) Large-scale
  dataset with various cross-validation sets. 2) A standardized training and hyperparameter
  selection. The experimental results show that a simple Multi- layer Perceptron and
  Linear Regression outperform the probabilistic models on RMSE without any feature
  engineering. Overall, the probabilistic models fail to achieve better performance
  on point estimation, such as RMSE and MAPE, than comparably simple baselines. We
  analyze and discuss the performances of probabilistic time-series models.
