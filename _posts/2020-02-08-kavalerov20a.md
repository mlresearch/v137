title: A study of quality and diversity in K+1 GANs
abstract: We study the $K+1$ GAN paradigm which generalizes the canonical true/fake
  GAN by training a generator with a $K+1$-ary classifier instead of a binary discriminator.
  We show how the standard formulation of the $K+1$ GAN does not take advantage of
  class information fully and show how its learned generative data distribution is
  no different than the distribution that a traditional binary GAN learns. We then
  investigate another GAN loss function that dynamically labels its data during training,
  and show how this leads to learning a generative distribution that emphasizes the
  target distribution modes. We investigate to what degree our theoretical expectations
  of these GAN training strategies have impact on the quality and diversity of learned
  generators on real-world data.
