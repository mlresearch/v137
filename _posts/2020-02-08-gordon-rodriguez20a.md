title: 'Uses and Abuses of the Cross-Entropy Loss: Case Studies in Modern Deep Learning'
abstract: Modern deep learning is primarily an experimental science, in which empirical
  advances occasionally come at the expense of probabilistic rigor. Here we focus
  on one such example; namely the use of the categorical cross-entropy loss to model
  data that is not strictly categorical, but rather takes values on the simplex. This
  practice is standard in neural network architectures with label smoothing and actor-mimic
  reinforcement learning, amongst others. Drawing on the recently discovered continuous-categorical
  distribution, we propose probabilistically-inspired alternatives to these models,
  providing an approach that is more principled and theoretically appealing. Through
  careful experimentation, including an ablation study, we identify the potential
  for outperformance in these models, thereby highlighting the importance of a proper
  probabilistic treatment, as well as illustrating some of the failure modes thereof.
